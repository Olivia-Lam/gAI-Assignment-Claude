Web Systems gAI assignment.

Prompt Used:
Create a website that serves as an onboarding wizard for new users
who are joining a community group for pet lovers. The website must
be a full-stack web application using PHP on the server side and
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript on the client side. For the
database, use a plain text flat-file in CSV format. The onboarding
workflow should consist of the following steps:
1) Username and Password - allows users to set their username and
initial password.
2) Personal Info - allows users to add their name and contact
information.
3) Profile Photo - allows users to upload a picture for their public
profile.
4) Pet Info - allows users to input details about the pets they
currently own, including pet name, breed, age, and photo.
5) Confirmation and Save - allows users to save everything they've
entered in the onboarding wizard.
Each onboarding step should be presented on a separate page with
next and previous buttons for easy navigation. Once users have
successfully completed the onboarding process, they can subsequently
log in and view the profiles of other users. They should also be
able to edit all of their information, except for the username, and
have the option to delete their profile entirely.
